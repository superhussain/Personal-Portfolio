Howdy reader! I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for being here on my site and staying here long enough to find this post. If you haven't noticed, this is the first post in this blog. The first of many I hope! At this point, I have no idea what I want to write about. Probably about some of the things I am working on, something cool I discovered, or just something random.

The reason I started this is because I wanted a place to voice myself. Recently I have taken a lot of time reflecting about life and my purpose on this planet. Most people have a lot of goals planned out and have outlined the rest of their life ahead of time. I will say this now... **I am not like most people.** The rest of my life is a blur in my head. For a long time I tried to figure out what I should do and what path I should take. After even more reflection, I figured instead of thinking about what I could do, I should just **start doing**.

I think this blog will allow me to do just that. It will keep me focused on trying to explore more areas and bring more content. Doing so will allow me to grow as a person and find my destiny. Before I leave this world, I want to leave behind something great. I want to be remembered with names like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. I think this is the first step getting there. If you would like to come along this journey with me, shoot a comment down below and introduce yourself!

This is a start of a big adventure. Wanna come along?

Signing off,

Hussain
