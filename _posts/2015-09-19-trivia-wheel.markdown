As a university student, I am apart of a few student groups where I am the head of marketing. My responsibility in these groups are to design posters and any other marketing material for the organization. I don't know if you knew this, but I am also pretty good with the codes. In fact, I write a blog where I share some of the things I have come across, most notably to do with the codes. Oh you already knew that? Good, you're at the right place!

As I was saying, I do stuff for student groups. We have something coming up where there is a small trivia game. In that game, the player will spin a wheel to choose the category of the question. The question is given to them and they will get prizes if they get questions correct. Now we thought of making this wheel out of cardboard or wood, which I was excited to take upon myself. We discussed it and thought that maybe we should stay away from a physical wheel because they are only temporary and can't be used in coming years. And that's where the idea of making an electronic wheel came from!

As a developer, I spend most of time time developing stuff for the web so it was obvious for me to use web technologies. The spinning wheel was based on [HTML5's canvas](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp) which was new for me so I learned quite a bit while making it. I also used [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) for its unparalleled selectors and everything else was based on simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Enough of me trying to explain it, why don't I just show you?

Pretty cool right? Feel free to steal the code so long as you learn from it!

Learn from it, add to it, and code on!
