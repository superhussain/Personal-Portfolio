  <hr>
  <p>Howdy friend, my name is Hussain. I am a university <strike>student</strike> <strong>dropout</strong> with a <em>burning</em> passion for technology!</p>
  <p>Why did I drop out? Well, university courses were too slow for my appetite, so I left school and got myself a solid foundation in design and development. Now I'm looking to satisfy my hunger by taking on exciting projects!</p>
  <p>Like what you see? <a href="mailto:howdy@hussainabbas.com" target="_blank"><span data-title="howdy@hussainabbas.com">Say hello! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></a></p>
  <!-- <p>I dabble in hardware, software and design. The problem with me is that I cannot focus on one particular area of interest at one time. Within the average day, I go from developing an app to designing a website and by the end of the day, I have cables and computer parts all over the place.
